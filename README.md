# PostgreSQL Tutorial
### A code institute code along project
This project introduces students to PostgreSQL. PostgreSQL is interacted with via the command line interface, using the [PsycoPG2 python library](sql-psycopg2.py), using [expression language with SQLAlchemy](sql-expression.py), and lastly by using [ORM with SQLAlchemy](sql-orm.py).
### What did I contribute?
The file [sql-challenge.py](sql-challenge.py) was entirely written by me independently. The challenge was to write the code necessary to create our own sql table. I chose to list my favourite video games. I took heavy influence from sql-orm.py but I did experiment a fair bit. Most notably the SQL terminal command `TRUNCATE TABLE "VideoGame" RESTART IDENTITY;` was very useful for when I needed to reset my table.
### Technologies used
Python, PsycoPG2, SQLAlchemy
